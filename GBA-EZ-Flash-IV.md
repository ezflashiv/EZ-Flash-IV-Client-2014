### Pitfalls

Some games require additional actions before usage. Download `GBA Tool Advance` tool and find a `IPS` file with a patch for a specific rom and apply it then burn as usual.

For example, Advanced Wars should be patched using GBATA's SRAM patcher on the .GBA file first, then burned with the EZ-Link client with `patch save` unchecked. More details in [this thread](http://ezflash.sosuke.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=13261&hilit=advance+wars)

Some games don't start at all and you see blank white screen instead. [This thread](http://ezflash.sosuke.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=11879) helped me, just download the patch and burn it on your gba.

### Skin

Just download the skin referenced in [this thread](http://www.sosuke.com/ezflash/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=17912). It's great. Place the downloaded file (`ezfla_up.bin` in root of SD card and boot GBA holding `R` button.
