Below you'll find list of keystrokes/commands built-in VIM by default which I'm using frequently.

## General

#### Normal mode

* `~` - invert case (upper->lower; lower->upper) of current character
* `xp` - swap two characters around
* `CTRL-a, CTRL-x` - increment, decrement next number on same line as the cursor

#### Visual mode

* `gq` - Break selected line into multiple lines
* `gu` - lowercase line
* `gU` - uppercase line

#### Command mode

* `:set paste` - enables paste mode which disables all automatic formatting. Highly useful when pasting some preformatted piece of code.
* `:set nopaste` - disables paste mode
