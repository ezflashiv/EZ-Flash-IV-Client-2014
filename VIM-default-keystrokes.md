Below you'll find list of keystrokes/commands built-in VIM by default which I'm using frequently.

## General

`:set paste` - enables paste mode which disables all automatic formatting. Highly useful when pasting some preformatted piece of code.
`:set paste&` - disables paste mode

`guu` - lowercase line

`gUU` - uppercase line

`~` - invert case (upper->lower; lower->upper) of current character

`xp` - swap next two characters around

`CTRL-A, CTRL-X` - increment, decrement next number on same line as the cursor
